## Day 1 - 02/08/2023

### <u>Time Spent:</u>
~2 hours coding overall

### <u>Thoughts:</u>

Today, I worked on learning how to better style my HTML code. I learnt about semantic HTML, which I then put into my code, which can be seen in any HTML file in the [docs](/docs/) folder.

I also learnt a lot about header elements, such as base and the viewport meta elements.

I feel good about what I did today, but I'm not that happy with the fact I couldn't get onto the CSS.

### <u> Tomorrow:</u>

Tomorrow, I want to get started on learning more complex CSS, and start by styling my contact page, since that has the least content and so will be the easiest to start with.

If I finish that quickly, then I will move onto working on the CSS for another page.

I will also start brainstorming more projects which I will want to complete by the end of this challenge.

### <u>Definitions:</u>

<dl>
    <dt>Semantic HTML</dt>
    <dd>This is HTML which gives HTML elements more context, which makes it easier for the developer to understand </dd>
    <dt>Base header element</dt>
    <dd>Defines a base URL for the page and a default way for how a URL is opened when a hyperlink is clicked</dd>
</dl>

Examples of Semantic HTML elements include: `<section>`, `<header`, `<footer>` and `<nav>` (These are the ones which I used today)

An example for using base is: `<base target="_blank">`, which will default all hyperlinks on the page to open in a new tab.

## Day 2 - 03/08/2023

### <u>Time Spent:</u>
~1hr 30mins coding

### <u>Thoughts:</u>

Today, I worked on learning more complex CSS, including proper positioning, name conventions and animations.

I was able to style my contacts page (please take into consideration I am NOT claiming to be a designer!)

Here, I learnt the BEM naming convention for CSS classes and ids, (Blocks, Elements, Modifiers).

I also learnt how to do CSS animations, and did a little bit of JS coding, in order to make the social media icons grow when you hover over the social tags.

### <u> Tomorrow:</u>

Tomorrow, I want to start the CSS for some of the other pages, and spend some more time on coding on this project, I'd say I want to spend ~3 hours coding.

In the 3 hours, I want to finish the CSS for both the main page and the projects page.

With the projects page, I want to have it so I have a tile of a photo of a project, then when you hover over the tile, some text shows which gives context to the project. (For now I will reference my Haskell Hutton project and then the rest can be placeholder text).

## Day 3 - 04/08/2023

### <u>Time Spent:</u>

Started at 11am, on and off until ~10am the next day<br /> SO 24hrs of on and off work

### <u>Thoughts:</u>

Today, I went completely off schedule. I just didn't feel motivated to do anything with my personal website. However, I woke up today with a new project in mind.

I wanted to create a web application which automatically creates a visual of the streaming schedule of my favourite streamer, AstralSpiff.

I knew, going into this, that this would be a hard challenge. I learnt a lot though, both backend and frontend. I learnt about JS promises (and eventually async & await), how to use the Date object, CSS webkits (sort of), along with much more.

Although I'm happy with my design, I know that it's probably very inefficient and metaphorically held together with sellotape. This is something I want to sort out in the coming days.

I don't know if this project is taking me too long, but I'm trying not to think of it as *"I have this project to do in this timeframe"* but more *"I have this project that I will work on at my pace, and take it as a learning curve"*, which is really helping me.

I'm also more and more accepting to mistakes, and being able to admit I don't know much, which is something I know I've needed to learn for a while.

### <u> Tomorrow:</u>

Tomorrow, I have work and so might not be able to do much here, but I want to continue with my Spiff project. I hope to streamline/optimize my API code, and sort out the CSS to be responsive.

So... essentially, rewrite my code, but better. Ahhh, web development.

## Day 4(ish) - 05/08/2023 & 06/08/2023

I had an unexpected shift change in my real job, meaning that I was too tired to do anything today. This won't count as a day

---

## Day 4 - 07/08/2023

### <u>Time Spent:</u>

~1/1:30hrs Spent Coding

### <u>Thoughts:</u>

Today, I realised my Spiff code was so messy, and I really needed to streamline and practice how I interacted with APIs (where it's more secure & safe when deployed, as well as just understandable when looking at the code), so I decided I wanted to start learning about Node.js, and so started a side-side project using Node.js to make code which uses Spotify's API to get information on AJR's profile.

My AJR project will be added on GitHub soon, but I am waiting till I sort out a way to store credentials securely.

### <u> Tomorrow:</u>

I'm going to continue with my Node.js learning today, see how far I can get with that, OR see if I can streamline my spiff code, making it way more easier to understand, as well as using good security practices. A lot to learn!

## Day 5(ish) - 08/08/2023

Lost Motivation

---

## Day 5 - 09/08/2023

### <u>Time Spent:</u>

~8 hours coding

### <u>Thoughts:</u>

Honestly, I want to stop losing motivation so quickly with my projects. I find it happens a lot, and quite honestly it gets embarrassing, especially when it's for a challenge like this.

So, today I rooted the problem to giving myself too many projects to work on, finishing maybe 50% of it, and then moving onto the next thing. So, I decided to start a project which I would be DEDICATED to till I finished it, a currency converter.

And I finished it! It took me a long time, into the early hours of the 10th, BUT I finished it, and I'm proud of it. The design looks clean, the API is smooth. Yes, I could clean up the code, but it works! Cleaning up the code, right now, is a 'grunt work' task that I might finish tomorrow whilst watching Spiff's stream.

I learnt so much too! I learnt how to have both frontend and backend files in one git repo, I learnt how express.js and axios work, I learnt about http-server, I learnt about HTML's select and option elements. 

I'm really proud with how this turned out! You can go check out the code [here](https://github.com/CellOrwell/currency-converter). (The README will also be a grunt work task, where I will explain how to set up everything.)

### <u> Tomorrow:</u>

Tomorrow (or should I say today), I'm gonna start a to-do list full stack project. This will be big, but I'm excited. I'm want to start by running a mysql server off my Raspberry Pi, and then work on the backend, before eventually moving to the frontend. Mainly because I don't know how I want it to look yet.

For this project, I want to learn Bootstrap (or other popular CSS frameworks), as well as React, Vue.js or Angular

I also think I'm going to pick up my Haskell work again, so a little less time will be spent on this project today.

---

## Day 6 - 10/08/2023

### <u>Time Spent:</u>

~ 1/1.5 hrs coding

### <u>Thoughts:</u>

Today, I spent the entire time setting up a local MySQL database on my Raspberry Pi, and then getting a simple script on my main PC to be able to connect to that database. I thought it was going to be straight forward, but it was so hard!! I had to worry about user permissions and user hostnames (which was the main part of the bugs). Eventually, I got it sorted and set up. At this point, I was too tired to get anything else on, and I had work in the morning, so I rested and went to bed.

### <u> Tomorrow:</u>

Tomorrow, after work, is going to be a focus on the Backend API. I want to get express setup and have endpoints to both receive and set information. Shouldn't take me too long since I'm familiar with express in the backend of my Currency Converter project. The new content I will be learning is making post requests with express, and also I'd like to know how to handle errors through express better. (and also sort out error handling for my DB connection).
