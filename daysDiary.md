## Day 1 - 02/08/2023

### <u>Time Spent:</u>
~2 hours coding overall

### <u>Thoughts:</u>

Today, I worked on learning how to better style my HTML code. I learnt about semantic HTML, which I then put into my code, which can be seen in any HTML file in the [docs](/docs/) folder.

I also learnt a lot about header elements, such as base and the viewport meta elements.

I feel good about what I did today, but I'm not that happy with the fact I couldn't get onto the CSS.

### <u> Tomorrow:</u>

Tomorrow, I want to get started on learning more complex CSS, and start by styling my contact page, since that has the least content and so will be the easiest to start with.

If I finish that quickly, then I will move onto working on the CSS for another page.

I will also start brainstorming more projects which I will want to complete by the end of this challenge.

### <u>Definitions:</u>

<dl>
    <dt>Semantic HTML</dt>
    <dd>This is HTML which gives HTML elements more context, which makes it easier for the developer to understand </dd>
    <dt>Base header element</dt>
    <dd>Defines a base URL for the page and a default way for how a URL is opened when a hyperlink is clicked</dd>
</dl>

Examples of Semantic HTML elements include: `<section>`, `<header`, `<footer>` and `<nav>` (These are the ones which I used today)

An example for using base is: `<base target="_blank">`, which will default all hyperlinks on the page to open in a new tab.

## Day 2 - 03/08/2023

### <u>Time Spent:</u>
~1hr 30mins coding

### <u>Thoughts:</u>

Today, I worked on learning more complex CSS, including proper positioning, name conventions and animations.

I was able to style my contacts page (please take into consideration I am NOT claiming to be a designer!)

Here, I learnt the BEM naming convention for CSS classes and ids, (Blocks, Elements, Modifiers).

I also learnt how to do CSS animations, and did a little bit of JS coding, in order to make the social media icons grow when you hover over the social tags.

### <u> Tomorrow:</u>

Tomorrow, I want to start the CSS for some of the other pages, and spend some more time on coding on this project, I'd say I want to spend ~3 hours coding.

In the 3 hours, I want to finish the CSS for both the main page and the projects page.

With the projects page, I want to have it so I have a tile of a photo of a project, then when you hover over the tile, some text shows which gives context to the project. (For now I will reference my Haskell Hutton project and then the rest can be placeholder text).

## Day 3 - 04/08/2023

### <u>Time Spent:</u>

Started at 11am, on and off until ~10am the next day<br /> SO 24hrs of on and off work

### <u>Thoughts:</u>

Today, I went completely off schedule. I just didn't feel motivated to do anything with my personal website. However, I woke up today with a new project in mind.

I wanted to create a web application which automatically creates a visual of the streaming schedule of my favourite streamer, AstralSpiff.

I knew, going into this, that this would be a hard challenge. I learnt a lot though, both backend and frontend. I learnt about JS promises (and eventually async & await), how to use the Date object, CSS webkits (sort of), along with much more.

Although I'm happy with my design, I know that it's probably very inefficient and metaphorically held together with sellotape. This is something I want to sort out in the coming days.

I don't know if this project is taking me too long, but I'm trying not to think of it as *"I have this project to do in this timeframe"* but more *"I have this project that I will work on at my pace, and take it as a learning curve"*, which is really helping me.

I'm also more and more accepting to mistakes, and being able to admit I don't know much, which is something I know I've needed to learn for a while.

### <u> Tomorrow:</u>

Tomorrow, I have work and so might not be able to do much here, but I want to continue with my Spiff project. I hope to streamline/optimize my API code, and sort out the CSS to be responsive.

So... essentially, rewrite my code, but better. Ahhh, web development.

## Day 4(ish) - 05/08/2023

I had an unexpected shift change in my real job, meaning that I was too tired to do anything today. This won't count as a day
