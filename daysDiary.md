## Day 1 - 02/08/2023

### <u>Time Spent:</u>
~2 hours coding overall

### <u>Thoughts:</u>

Today, I worked on learning how to better style my HTML code. I learnt about semantic HTML, which I then put into my code, which can be seen in any HTML file in the [docs](/docs/) folder.

I also learnt a lot about header elements, such as base and the viewport meta elements.

I feel good about what I did today, but I'm not that happy with the fact I couldn't get onto the CSS.

### <u> Tomorrow:</u>

Tomorrow, I want to get started on learning more complex CSS, and start by styling my contact page, since that has the least content and so will be the easiest to start with.

If I finish that quickly, then I will move onto working on the CSS for another page.

I will also start brainstorming more projects which I will want to complete by the end of this challenge.
