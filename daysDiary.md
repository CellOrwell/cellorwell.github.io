## Day 1 - 02/08/2023

### <u>Time Spent:</u>
~2 hours coding overall

### <u>Thoughts:</u>

Today, I worked on learning how to better style my HTML code. I learnt about semantic HTML, which I then put into my code, which can be seen in any HTML file in the [docs](/docs/) folder.

I also learnt a lot about header elements, such as base and the viewport meta elements.

I feel good about what I did today, but I'm not that happy with the fact I couldn't get onto the CSS.

### <u> Tomorrow:</u>

Tomorrow, I want to get started on learning more complex CSS, and start by styling my contact page, since that has the least content and so will be the easiest to start with.

If I finish that quickly, then I will move onto working on the CSS for another page.

I will also start brainstorming more projects which I will want to complete by the end of this challenge.

### <u>Definitions:</u>

<dl>
    <dt>Semantic HTML</dt>
    <dd>This is HTML which gives HTML elements more context, which makes it easier for the developer to understand </dd>
    <dt>Base header element</dt>
    <dd>Defines a base URL for the page and a default way for how a URL is opened when a hyperlink is clicked</dd>
</dl>

Examples of Semantic HTML elements include: `<section>`, `<header`, `<footer>` and `<nav>` (These are the ones which I used today)

An example for using base is: `<base target="_blank">`, which will default all hyperlinks on the page to open in a new tab.

### <u>Resources Used:</u>

## Day 2 - 03/08/2023

### <u>Time Spent:</u>
~1hr 30mins coding

### <u>Thoughts:</u>

Today, I worked on learning more complex CSS, including proper positioning, name conventions and animations.

I was able to style my contacts page (please take into consideration I am NOT claiming to be a designer!)

Here, I learnt the BEM naming convention for CSS classes and ids, (Blocks, Elements, Modifiers).

I also learnt how to do CSS animations, and did a little bit of JS coding, in order to make the social media icons grow when you hover over the social tags.

### <u> Tomorrow:</u>

Tomorrow, I want to start the CSS for some of the other pages, and spend some more time on coding on this project, I'd say I want to spend ~3 hours coding.

In the 3 hours, I want to finish the CSS for both the main page and the projects page.

With the projects page, I want to have it so I have a tile of a photo of a project, then when you hover over the tile, some text shows which gives context to the project. (For now I will reference my Haskell Hutton project and then the rest can be placeholder text).
